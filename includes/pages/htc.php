			<h2><strong>Welcome to <?php echo $sname; ?>!</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br /></strong>We're really excited that you've decided to join our community! To get started playing as quickly as possible simply follow the steps listed below and you'll be playing in no time. If you have any problems getting started please don't hesitate to contact us for <a href="../forum">support</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> First, you must register an account on <?php echo $sname; ?>. Your account will be used to log into both the game and our website. <a href="../register.php">Click here</a> to open the registration page.</p>
<p><br /> <strong>2.</strong> Install World of Warcraft. You can download it from our torrent by clicking <a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:506C4EA5AF0304F66B8081F318EE4D7282EA2AEE&amp;dn=WoW%20Forever%203.3.5a.rar&amp;tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3a80%2fannounce&amp;tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.opentrackr.org%3a1337%2fannounce">HERE</a>. (In order to download our 3.3.5a client you will require torrenting software. We recommend: <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/intl/en/">UTorrent</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Once you have downloaded our client you can simply double click on the "Play <?php echo $sname; ?>" icon, then all you need to do is login with the account you registered earlier and you're all set! (No need to continue reading unless you downloaded your client elsewhere)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;If you are using a client you already have downloaded then open up your "World of Warcraft" directory. The default directory is "C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft". When you've found it, open up the directory called "data", then go into the directory called either enUS or enGB, depending on your client language.</p>
<p><br /> <strong>5.</strong> Open up the file called "realmlist.wtf" with a text editor such as Notepad. To do this, you must right click on the file and choose properties, then select notepad as the default software for files with the ".wtf" ending. You may also just start the text editor and drag the file into the edit window.</p>
<p><br /> <strong>6.</strong> Erase all text and change it to:</p>
<div style="padding: 30px; display: block; font-weight: bold;">set realmlist <?php echo $srealmlist; ?>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>See you In-game!</strong></p>
